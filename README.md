# DataAnalyzer

This collection of tools is published by Gautier Michelin, idéesculture SAS.

It mainly is a collection of tools to work on data tables (CSV, XLSX, XML), establishing a review of their columns and having a sneak peak on their contents to establish the best way to import them into a new software/platform.

This collection of programs have been developed to answer a challenge involved by the software move from different databases to Ishtar, an opensource platform for archeology, developed by Iggdrasil. We have been endorsed for this project by the DRASSM (France — Ministère de la culture).

The code base aims to endorse new challenge and projects, thinking around CollectiveAccess data import and GLAM databases.
